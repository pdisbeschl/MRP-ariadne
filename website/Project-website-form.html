<h4>Problem statement and motivation:</h4>
<p align="justify">
A standard practice in software development is to write documentation regarding each part of the software as it is being developed. This documentation is regarded as a description of the software, with the intention of informing the intended audience of the functions, possibilities and limitations of the software. Documentation includes manuals, tutorials, guides and more. Unfortunately, numerous factors can lead to a lack of (adequate) documentation, rendering potential groundbreaking programs to be unused by the intended audience. We aim to discover methods and practices for the development of documentation for a program which is near completion, such that its intended audience is able to use the software with ease.
</p>
<p align = "justify">
A perfect candidate for this project is Ariadne, a novel open-source software library intended for the formal verification of complex systems through rigorous numerical analysis. Ariadne's documentation is incomplete, not fully up-to-date, and difficult to understand by the intended audience (DKE students). Our goal is for the intended audience to be able to use the software successfully using no assistance other than the documentation itself.

<!-- The probem statement should not be any longer than this -->
<h4 style="color:red;">Problem statement and motivation (original - can we use the part above instead? Keep a copy of this section for the report though):</h4>
<!-- Stuff about how software needs docs and tutorials for intended audience -->
<!-- Stuff about how especially FLOSS software tends to lack documentation since there's no financial incentive -->
<!-- Paul's ideas for research questions -->
    <!-- How can we create easy-to-use docs/tutorials so that the intended audience can use it well? -->
    <!-- How can we do this without knowing all of the software? -->
    <!-- How can we accurately measure the effect of improved usage instructions? -->
    <!-- What makes software easy-to-use? -->
    <!-- NOT SURE -> How can we make sure documentation doesn't become out of date again? -->
<p style="color:red;" align="justify"> <!-- I honestly think the next paragraph (which is good) should be in the report, not here -->
    In all branches of engineering, verification is a very important step to make sure that the designed product works as expected in every situation it encounters. Rather than testing everything on the actual system, it is typically easier and cheaper to perform tests on a replication of the system instead. This model must be designed in such a way that it accurately simulates the real-world behaviors and constraints of the actual system. Since not every condition can be replicated exactly, solutions are approximated through numerical analysis. These calculations must be highly accurate and as such cannot be implemented easily by standard libraries, since these typically output exact symbolic answers. 
</p>
<p style="color:red;" align="justify">    <!-- Yes. Keep this. -->
   Ariadne is a software library, written in C++ with bindings in Python, specifically designed for accurate verification through rigorous numerical approximation. Rigorous numerics, a subfield of numerical analysis, is used for generating thorough numerical aproximations for various field of mathematics. 
</p>
<p style="color:red;" align="justify">    <!-- Grammar & spelling mistakes, need to fix this, incorporate it with top -->
    At the moment, it is a challenge to get started with Ariadne because of the documentation. Parts of it are out of date, difficult to comprehend and useful information for beginners is often missing. By improving it and adding missing parts, it could be more accessible to students and other people who might benefit from it.

<h4>Research questions/hypotheses:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is the most effective way to document software?</li>
<li>How can the effectiveness of software documentation be evaluated?</li>
<li>To what degree does the intended audience influence the format and style of the documentation?</li>
<li>Which parts of the documentation are most important to the usabiltiy of software?</li>
<li>To what degree can documentation developers make assumptions regarding the intended audience's knowledge?</li>
<li>To what degree do documentation developers require knowledge of the software's real-world applications in order to define quality instructions?</li>
<li>What makes software easy to use?</li>
<li>What measures can be taken to ensure documentation does not become out-of-date?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Main outcomes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved installation and "Getting Started" parts of the existing documentation so that end-users can execute basic tasks without problems. To achieve this, the installation process has to work without errors. Furthermore, a section for common issues and frequently asked questions should be included, as well as links to general information like the programming language and the usage of the command line.</li>
<li>New tutorials created in an understandable and easy-to-use standardized format, with existing tutorials converted in this same format.</li>   
<li>Experiments with Bachelor students to test the impact of the improvements and get input for future work.</li>
<li>New methods for testing the efficacy of software documentation, along with metrics for quantifying this.</li>
<li>Reports of our own experiences with the software to assist the developers.</li>
</ul>
