<h4>Problem statement and motivation:</h4>
<p align="justify">
A standard practice in software development is to write documentation regarding each part of the software as it is being developed. This documentation is regarded as a description of the software, with the intention of informing the intended audience of the functions, possibilities and limitations of the software. Documentation includes manuals, tutorials, guides and more. Unfortunately, numerous factors can lead to a lack of (adequate) documentation, rendering potential groundbreaking programs to be unused by the intended audience. We aim to discover methods and practices for the development of documentation for a program which is near completion, such that its intended audience can use the software with ease.
</p>
<p align = "justify">
A perfect candidate for this project is Ariadne, a novel open-source software library intended for the formal verification of complex systems through rigorous numerical analysis. Ariadne's documentation is incomplete, not fully up-to-date, and difficult to understand by the intended audience (DKE students). Our goal is for the intended audience to be able to use the software successfully using no assistance other than the documentation itself.
</p> 
<h4>Research questions/hypotheses:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is the most effective way to document software?</li>
<li>How can the effectiveness of software documentation be evaluated?</li>
<li>To what degree does the intended audience influence the format and style of the documentation?</li>
<li>Which parts of the documentation are most important to the usability of software?</li>
<li>To what degree can documentation developers make assumptions regarding the intended audience's knowledge?</li>
<li>To what degree do documentation developers require knowledge of the software's real-world applications in order to define quality instructions?</li>
<li>What makes software easy to use?</li>
<li>What measures can be taken to ensure documentation does not become out-of-date?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Main outcomes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved installation and "Getting Started" parts of the existing documentation so that end-users can execute basic tasks without problems.</li> 
<li>A section in the documentation for common issues and frequently asked questions, as well as links to general information regarding the use of the underlying programming languages and the command line.</li>
<li>New tutorials created in an understandable and easy-to-use standardized format, with existing tutorials converted in this same format.</li>   
<li>Experiments with Bachelor students to test the impact of the improvements and get input for future work.</li>
<li>New methods for testing the efficacy of software documentation, along with metrics for quantifying this.</li>
<li>Reports of our own experiences with the software to assist the developers.</li>
</ul>
