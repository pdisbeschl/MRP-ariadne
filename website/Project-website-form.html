<h4>Problem statement and motivation:</h4>
<p align=”justify”>
When it comes to the programming of scientific software, 
<!-- Stuff about how software needs docs and tutorials for intended audience -->
<!-- Stuff about how especially FLOSS software tends to lack documentation since there's no financial incentive -->
<!-- Paul's ideas for research questions -->
    <!-- How can we create easy-to-use docs/tutorials so that the intended audience can use it well? -->
    <!-- How can we do this without knowing all of the software? -->
    <!-- How can we accurately measure the effect of improved usage instructions? -->
    <!-- What makes software easy-to-use? -->
    <!-- NOT SURE -> How can we make sure documentation doesn't become out of date again? -->
</p>
<p align=”justify”> <!-- I honestly think the next paragraph (which is good) should be in the report, not here -->
    In all branches of engineering, verification is a very important step to make sure that the designed product works as expected in every situation it encounters. Rather than testing everything on the actual system, it is typically easier and cheaper to perform tests on a replication of the system instead. This model must be designed in such a way that it accurately simulates the real-world behaviors and constraints of the actual system. Since not every condition can be replicated exactly, solutions are approximated through numerical analysis. These calculations must be highly accurate and as such cannot be implemented easily by standard libraries, since these typically output exact symbolic answers. 
</p>
<p align=”justify”>    <!-- Yes. Keep this. -->
   Ariadne is a software library, written in C++ with bindings in Python, specifically designed for accurate verification through rigorous numerical approximation. Rigorous numerics, a subfield of numerical analysis, is used for generating thorough numerical aproximations for various field of mathematics. 
</p>
<p align=”justify”>    <!-- Grammar & spelling mistakes, need to fix this, incorporate it with top -->
    At the moment, it is a challenge to get started with Ariadne because of the documentation. Parts of it are out of date, difficult to comprehend and useful information for beginners is often missing. By improving it and adding missing parts, it could be more accessible to students and other people who might benefit from it.

<h4>Research questions/hypotheses:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What parts of the documentation are most important to be improved to make it more usable?</li>
<li>What are some example cases ARIADNE can be used?</li>
<li>??? ?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Main outcomes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improve the installation and "Getting Started" part of the documentation to make sure that people are able to use it. To achieve this, the installation process has to work without errors. Furthermore, a section for common issues and frequently asked questions should be included, as well as links to general information like the programming language and the usage of the command line.</li>
<li>Bring important tutorials into a form that makes them understandable and easy to use by for example adding information or converting it to a Jupyter Notebook.</li>
<li>Add new tutorials.</li>    
<li>Do an experiment with Bachelor students to test the impact of the improvements and get input for future work.</li>
<li>Provide reports of our own experiences to the developers and give suggestions how the documentation could be improved, as we are also using the software for the first time.</li>
</ul>
